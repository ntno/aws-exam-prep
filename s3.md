#### server side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed keys  
* objects encrypted with UNIQUE key  
  * employing strong multi-factor encryption (?)
* master key used to encrypt the object keys
  * master key regularly rotates
* AES-256
  * use the x-amz-server-side-encryption header

#### large objects with Multipart upload API
* recommended for items over 100 MB
1) initiate upload
2) upload parts
3)complete upload
  * S3 reconstructs the object from parts
  * large object then can be retrieved as normal
* you can upload parts in parallel
* you can pause and resume upload (the upload is only complete after you make the complete api call)
* you can begin the upload before you know the final object size / as the file is being created

#### CORS - Cross-origin resource sharing
* allows resources in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain  
* you can selectively allow cross-origin access
