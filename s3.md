# S3 - Simple Storage Service

* read-after-write consistency for **new** PUTS
* eventual consistency for **overwrite** PUTS
* eventual consistency for DELETES
* objects in bucket before versioning is turned on have a version of NULL  
* 100 buckets maximum per account
* maximum size of item 5 TB (above 100 MB, use multipart upload)
* name between 3 and 63 characters
* name cannot be in IP address format
* lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens
* name must start/end with either letter or number
* recommendation: do not use periods in the name

#### access options
* user/application creates a presigned URL then gives it to a third user.  as long as the person who created the URL has access upload/download the object, then the third user can as well.  this allows fine-grained control of who can upload/download objects to bucket without setting up special users/roles for everyone
  * you can also set the URLs to expire
* bucket policy
* ACL - access control list for the resource
* access policies assigned to users in your account
* any combo of these is allowed


#### server side encryption with Amazon S3-Managed keys  
* objects encrypted with UNIQUE key  
  * employing strong multi-factor encryption (?)
* master key used to encrypt the object keys
  * master key regularly rotates
* AES-256
  * use the x-amz-server-side-encryption header

#### large objects with Multipart upload API
* recommended for items over 100 MB
1) initiate upload
2) upload parts
3)complete upload
  * S3 reconstructs the object from parts
  * large object then can be retrieved as normal
* you can upload parts in parallel
* you can pause and resume upload (the upload is only complete after you make the complete api call)
* you can begin the upload before you know the final object size / as the file is being created

#### CORS - Cross-origin resource sharing
* allows resources in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain  
* you can selectively allow cross-origin access

#### partitioning (??)
aws maintains an index of keys across multiple partitions  
it is possible to overwhelm the I/O capacity of a partition if you keep creating keys with very similar names (same at the beginning of the key since they are sorted alphabetically)  
so it is a good idea to add some randomness to the first part of a key name if you have very high traffic  
if not then go with sec/hour/day/month/year so that all the files are not going to the same partition
